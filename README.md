# Deep Learning Practical Examples

Neural Network & Deep Learning Course  Laboratory practices at UNIPD
            
The course covers the theory and practice of artificial neural networks,
with an emphasis on deep learning and computational modeling

Deep Learning Examples include deep learning sample projects that I practice by myself.
