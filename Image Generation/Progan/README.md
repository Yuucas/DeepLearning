# PROGAN

The implementation of PROGAN is made from strach.

To run both models, it is sufficient to write a command like "python train.py dataset_folder generated_image_folder" in the terminal.

- train.py: the script
- dataset_folder: the directory of the dataset
- generated_image_folder: the directory of the generated image set

If you would like to see more generated images and metric, you can use tensorboard from terminal as follows:
- tensorboard --logdir logs
